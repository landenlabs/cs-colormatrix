This C# application demonstrates the effect of using the ColorMatrix operator on an image. This program contains several sample matrix filters which you can select and modify. The top portion of the program interface contains three images. A background image, an overlay and the result of applying the color matrix on the overlay rendered on top of the background image. Each of the three panels display their image over a checkerboard background to make it easier to see partial transparent areas (alpha < 255). The bottom section of the interface shows the active color matrix filter on the left and a gallery of pre-built filters on the right.
